<h1 align=center>404 page does not load when using Yarn 2</h1>

<br>
<br>

## Steps to reproduce

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run `npm start` (which itself calls `yarn next`)
3. Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser

Everything is checked in, so no installs are needed â€“ not even yarn is required!
